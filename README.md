<h1>Simple games</h1>
Project contains a large number of terminal games from era learning programming. All games was write in programming language C and each game solves certain algorithm problem.

<h3>Tetris </h3>
Game called  the tetris or simple dices. Main idea game is falling block of 4 dices from top to bottom. A Player sort falling blocks in bottom row. Goal game is fill a row without a gap. After you fill the row, the row is remove from the game. The player tries long time remove bottom rows, because when a falling block fill all a posible space the game end. At once you can remove only four rows, because max length block is formed by four dices vertical called “I” or “tetris”.

<h3>Sudoku</h3>
Sudoku is a logical numbers game for one player. The classic Sudoku game involves a grid of 81 squares. The grid is divided into nide block, each block contain nine squeares. The rule of the game are simple: Each of the nine block should contain all the numbers 1-9 within its squares. Each number can only once appear in a row, a column and a block. The difficulty lies in that all a vertical nine-square column, a horizontal nine-square line and a box must also contain the numbembers 1-9 without repettion or omission.

<b>Describe algorithm generate sudoku</b>
<br>
The algorithm inicialize sequence numbers for filling fields. After it recursive tries put one number from the sequence numbers and it test if the number really belong to this field. The algorithm tries put another numbers consecutive. It returns back to previous field and examine other number from sequence if it does not put nothing a number from the sequence. In last step remove numbers from a grid on random positions. Difficult the game is given how many fields will be removed from the grid after generate.

<h3>Tic tac toe </h3>
A Game knows as “English Grinder” too. A goal the game is create line (vertical, horizontal or bevel) from three stones. When you know the game piskvorky, the tic tac toe is very similar and you love it for simplicity.

<b>How do you play?</b>
Each player has four stones. Players put stones on the  game board. Player win if he create line from three stones. So players put all stones into the gameboard, game finish with state (Remiza - draw)

<h3>King walk</h3>
Algorithm solves mathematic and chess problem. The problem turns around moves figure king on a chessboard. The king move by chess rules on empty the chessboard. Goal is visit each field on chessboar once one.

And another algorithm games :)
